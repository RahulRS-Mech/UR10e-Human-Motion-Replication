# UR10e-Human-Motion-Replication

This project explores how **robotic systems can accurately replicate human movement**, bridging the gap between **biomechanics and robotics**. The goal was to program a **UR10e robotic arm** to mimic **human motion patterns** with **smooth, repeatable, and precise movements**.  

Instead of using motion sensors, we **recorded human movement using a high-speed camera**, extracting **position, velocity, and acceleration** data using **motion tracking software**. This data was then used to generate **robotic motion trajectories**, which were later compared to the arm's actual movements to verify replication accuracy.  

This work has potential applications in **biomechanics research, automation, and AI-driven motion learning**.
